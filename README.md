# Unity Prefab Example

## Download and Open Project

When Unity opens a project, it uses the directory name as the project name.

You can download and open the project by cloning the repository. Use the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/safecorners/unity-prefab-example.git UnityPrefabExample
```

Alternatively, you can rename the directory before opening the project.
